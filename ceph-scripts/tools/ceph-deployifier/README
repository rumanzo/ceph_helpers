ceph-deployifier

Used to convert an "old" cernceph|enovance/puppet-ceph prepared OSD to one that 
looks like it was prepared by ceph-deploy, i.e. ceph-disk.

There are two tools: one to create new empty ceph journal partitions, and one to
move/relink OSDs to these new journals.

Be careful, there are many hardcoded dev names throughout. Adjust for your specific
needs.
